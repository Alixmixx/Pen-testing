##`SMB`

Server Message Block (SMB) is a network file-sharing protocol enabling computers to share files, printers, and resources. Initially developed by Microsoft, it supports cross-platform communication. SMB has versions like SMB1 (outdated and insecure), SMB2, and SMB3 (introducing security and performance enhancements). Authentication is required for access, and Samba is an open-source implementation allowing non-Windows systems to interact with Windows using SMB. SMB typically uses ports 137-139 and 445. While suitable for local network sharing, for secure internet communication, alternatives like SSH and SFTP are recommended.
